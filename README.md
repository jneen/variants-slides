# Variants are not Unions

Talk here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQkIWWTygio

The talk was presented in vim, by binding left and right arrow to `:N` and `:n` respectively.  You can run the presentation with

```
vim 4x3/*/*
# or
vim 16x9/*/*
```

I used Ubuntu Mono Regular at 30pt for 4x3 and at 40pt for 16x9.
